# challenge_2_creating_my_portfolio

## DESCRIPTION

I was motivated to build this project because it will help me to get jobs. By creating a portfolio like this, I can showcase all of my knowledge about HTML/CSS, as well as provide my work pieces to companies that are willing to hire me. This portfolio, will tell employers a little about me and what I can bring to the table by showing them my projects that I created. They will also be able to keep in touch with me because I have provided them my contact details. By doing this project, I have learned how to code in HTML as well as CSS. Although I am not that good at it, it gives me practice so eventually I can get better and can eventually create a better portfolio.
